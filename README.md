# PYTHON-Handle_Missing_values

In data analytics, clean, quality data is essential to running meaningful and reliable analyses. Just as you wouldn’t build a house without first laying a good foundation, you can’t analyze your data without cleaning it first. Get the data cleaning stage right and you’ll create something strong, reliable, and long-lasting 

Every dataset has missing values that need to be handled intelligently to create a robust model. Here I have discussed 6 ways to handle missing values that can handle missing values in every type of column with their pros and cons.

There is no thump rule to handle missing values in a particular manner, the method which gets a robust model with the best performance. One can use various methods on different features depending on how and what the data is about. Having domain knowledge about the dataset is important, which can give an insight into how to preprocess the data and handle missing values.

1. Drop the coulmn that have missing values
2. Impute missing values with Mean/Median
3. Impute missing value in categorical column WITH MOST FREQUENT VALUES
4. Impute missing values using logistic Regression
5. KNN Imputation
6. Imputing missing values using Deep learning(datawig library)
